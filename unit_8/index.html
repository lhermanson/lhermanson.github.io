					<p>"the year was 1972 and it was October. I went over to our house, just before they added on the addition. The fireplace was in the middle of the living room between the two walls and the piano was right next to that and I was sitting on the piano bench. Grandma was bringing in the dried clothes from the backyard through the sliding door – just to the right of the fireplace. Dad was sitting on the couch behind the Filipino coffee table. He was about 48 years old.</p>

					<p>I was telling dad that I was getting married to a girl from st. louis whos dad was a Presbyterian evangelical minister and she already had a daughter.  Dad said “you mean the checker at the commissary store?!” I said yes. And that’s when he got upset. He jumped over the coffee table and ran into Grandma who was bringing in the clothes. She cussed in tagalog and yelled: “what is wrong with you?!”</p>

					<p>Dad came after me and I started running. I ran through the kitchen while trying to get my Volkswagen keys out of my jeans pocket. I’m running out the kitchen door and he picks up one of our little league bats and he starts ch.</p>

					<p>I ran to the Anderson/McClure house house. And I ask the Mrs. Anderson if I can come through the hosue. She said sure come on through.</p>

					<p>As I went around the entryway and around her sectional couch. I open up the sliding door and sceen door and close the screen door in back of me. Dad comes thourgh the front door unannounced and goes through the living room and crashes thorugh the screen door.</p>

					<p>I’ve already climbed up onto a 4 foot retaining wall. Dad starts swigning at my feet and I jump off and so I jumped from the wall onto the frontyard grass.</p> 

					<p>Dad goes back throught the house to come after me. I still dindt have time to get to the vokswagen so I run down the street to a Winnebago and run around that with Dad chasing me in circles around the Winnebago 2-3 times.</p> 

					<p>I finally get to the Volkswagen and saw that my dad was losing air, so I turned around and said “you’ll never catch me you old man!”</p>

					<p>And that’s when dad got his second wind and started catching me. I ran to my frien’ds house that was across mission village drive. I went with him and Keith to the beach and when I got back, the two tires on the drivers side were flat. I went around the corner and filled up the tires and drove back to my apt.</p>

					<p>I didn’t talk to Dad again until Dec 30. Ed had called me and said that “any kid that comes to your wedding is not allowed in the hosue again.” Ed said that I should talk to him again and that he had camled him down</p>

					<p>I got married on Jan 1, 1973 and everyone came. There were twice as many filpinos as Caucasians and they all brought Filipino food." - Andy</p>
